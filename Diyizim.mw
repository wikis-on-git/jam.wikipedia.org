 --><ref>''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 2012 [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156154/Deism Deism] "In general, Deism refers to what can be called natural religion, the acceptance of a certain body of religious knowledge that is inborn in every person or that can be acquired by the use of reason and the rejection of religious knowledge when it is acquired through either revelation or the teaching of any church.}}</ref><!--
 --><ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5049-deism/] ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906. "DEISM: A system of belief which posits God's existence as the cause of all things, and admits His perfection, but rejects Divine revelation and government, proclaiming the all-sufficiency of natural laws."

 --><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm/ Deism] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', ed. Francis Aveling, 1908. "The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion." Axes 2012-10-10</ref><!--
 --><ref>[http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/deism/ deism] ''Webster's 1828 Dictionary'', 1828. "The doctrine or creed of a deist; the belief or system of religious opinions of those who acknowledge the existence of one God, but deny revelation: or deism is the belief in natural religion only, or those truths, in doctrine and practice, which man is to discover by the light of reason, independent and exclusive of any revelation from God. Hence deism implies infidelity or a disbelief in the divine origin of the scriptures." Axes 2012-10-10</ref><!--
 --><ref>''The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization'', 2011. "Deism is a rationalistic, critical approach to theism with an emphasis on natural theology. The Deists attempted to reduce religion to what they regarded as its most foundational, rationally justifiable elements. Deism is not, strictly speaking, the teaching that God wound up the world like a watch and let it run on its own, though that teaching was embraced by some within the movement." </ref>
